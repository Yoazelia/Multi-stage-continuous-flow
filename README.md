# Multistage Continuous Flow Manufacturing Process Prediction

## Description
Aims to predict the output of a multistage continuous flow manufacturing process using machine learning. The process consists of two stages, with three machines in parallel in the first stage and two machines in series in the second stage. The output of the process is measured at 15 locations around the outer surface of the material exiting the second stage. The dataset can be found at here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/supergus/multistage-continuousflow-manufacturing-process
